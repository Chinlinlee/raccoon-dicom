HostTable BEGIN
#
# The HostTable defines symbolic names for collections of network
# DICOM Application Entities.  A symbolic name can represent a single
# application entity or it can represent a group of application entities.
# Each DICOM application entity is defined by a triple consisting of
# Application Entity Title, host name and TCP/IP port number.
#
# Entry Format: SymbolicName = ( AETitle, HostName, Portnumber ), ...   |
#               SymbolicName = SymbolicName, ...
#
# NOTE: in the current implementation you cannot substitute an IP address
# for a hostname.

VendorTable BEGIN
#
# The VendorTable is used by the dcmqrdb and dcmqrti applications.
# You can give a vendor name (r.h.s. entry below) to the dcmqrti
# program and it will talk to all hosts and AEs of the vendor.
# The dcmqrdb program can use the vendor table to restrict move destination
# to hosts belonging to a vendor.
# Also, the dcmqrti and dcmqrdb programs use the name defined on the left hand side
# as the vendor name to display above images.
#
# The format:
#       VendorName = SymbolicName
# The symbolic name should be defined in the HostTable.

AETable BEGIN
#
# Each row of the AETable defines an Application Entities (AE) Title known
# to the dcmqrdb application.  Each AE Title represents a separate
# image database located in the specified file system directory (storage area).
# Each AE Title has read/write, quota and peer access restrictions.

# Entry Format: AETitle  StorageArea  Access  Quota  Peers
